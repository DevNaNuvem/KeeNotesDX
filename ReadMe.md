## Other devices

Not ideal, but those are some alternatives that can opens .kdbx databases on your other devices.

- [KeePass XC](https://keepassxc.org/) (https://keepassxc.org/) works with **GNU/Linux**, **Mac** and **Windows**, is updated regularly and under the terms of the GNU General Public License. This is the recommended version for computers.

- [KeePass](https://keepass.info/) (https://keepass.info/) is the historical project, with good technical documentation for standardized database files but only running on **Windows**.
